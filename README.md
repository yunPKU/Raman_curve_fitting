# Raman_curve_fitting
This files performs the peak fitting and the calculation of Raman polymerization index (or Ip value) for a specific Raman spectrum.
The input is a Raman spectrum where the baseline has already been subtracted as in Philippe Colomban, JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY, 2006.

We also provided a demo_curve for practice.
